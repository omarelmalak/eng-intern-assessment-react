# Project Overview
The goal of this project was to implement a stopwatch application. To do this, I used React, TypeScript, CSS, Bootstrap, and JDOM/Jest UI Testing. The stopwatch has the following functionalities:

- Start the stopwatch to begin counting time.
- Stop the stopwatch to pause the timer.
- Displays Laps when a button is pressed.
- Reset the stopwatch to zero.

This project was completed to participate in the Shopify Frontend Development Technical Challenge.

## Extra Notes
This project's color scheme and visuals were inspired by one of Shopify's landing pages that can be accessed with the following link:

This project provided me with an enjoyable platform to not only write some code, but to also work on my design thinking (i.e. using Photoshop to create a new logo for my mock Shopify-esque product and researching/implementing Shopify color schemes and other visuals) and I am thankful to Shopify for the opportunity to participate!

## Final Remarks
This was my first time ever using React to develop a web application! My prior experience lies in Flutter for iOS/Android application development, so I am excited about sharing what I have completed using a brand new framework and language. Jumping straight into a project and relying on online resources was definitely a challenge, but a challenge worthwhile nonetheless as I am very pleased with the final product and the effort I put into learning the language to turn the ideas I had into reality. 

Some transferable skills from Flutter helped me out with a lot of key structural ideas for the project, along with a few finer details and design elements. If I had more time to work on this project, I would have worked on improving the test suites, along with some of the visuals (buttons, shadowing, borders, etc...) and some new features (more analytics of lap times other than max/min lap times, such as a graph of laptimes and averages).
